      Add the `sessionId` provided in the [postMessage for the device data
      collection form
      (web)](/products/access/payments/enable-features/3ds-authentication/web)
      or for native (iOS/Android), returned as `consumerSessionId` as part of
      [SDK
      initialization](/products/access/payments/enable-features/3ds-authentication/android-ios).
      <br><br>__Note:__ If device data collection fails you can attempt the
      payment without this value, but you will see an increased number of
      `challenged` and even `authenticationFailure` outcomes, if this happens
      for a lot of requests.
